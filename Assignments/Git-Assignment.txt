Create a separate directory in github called Assignments

Create a file in the assignments directory with all list of git commands that you have learned

Use git add to add that file/directory to the repository.

Use git commit to commit your change. Use a meaningful message like "Added information about git command by your name."

Use git push to send your change to the repository.

Look online to see if your change has been pushed.

Wait until your partner has pushed their update. Then use git pull to get their change into your repository. Verify that you have the new file.

Use git log or git log | less to see a list of changes to the repository.

Deal with any conflicts that have arisen and commit the result.
